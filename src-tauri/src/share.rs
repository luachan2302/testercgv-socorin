//! "Upload & copy link": sharing a capture on socorin.com.
//!
//! One click uploads the annotated PNG (or the recording) to the share
//! server named in Settings (`upload_server`, socorin.com by default) and
//! puts the link it answers with on the clipboard. The server keeps a file
//! for a limited time and takes a size limit; both come from the server
//! (`Limits`), nothing is hard-coded here. Every link comes with a delete
//! token, which is kept with the last `HISTORY_LIMIT` links in
//! `shares.json` next to the settings, so a file can be taken down again
//! from Settings → Share or from the popover that announces the link.
//!
//! Nothing is uploaded unless the user asks for it. The only thing the
//! server learns about the install is a random id it hands out itself
//! (`register`), its spam control; there are no accounts.
//!
//! The protocol (v1, fixed on both sides):
//!
//! ```text
//! GET    /api/upload/limits                        → Limits (cached per run)
//! POST   /api/app/register  {platform, appVersion} → {installId}, once per install
//! POST   /api/upload/init   {kind, mime, size, sha256, filename}
//!                                                  → {uploadId, chunkBytes, totalChunks, uploadToken, expiresAt}
//! PUT    /api/upload/{uploadId}/chunks/{index}     Bearer uploadToken, octet-stream (idempotent)
//! POST   /api/upload/{uploadId}/complete           Bearer uploadToken → ShareResult
//! DELETE /api/media/{id}                           Bearer deleteToken → 204
//! ```
//!
//! Every request carries `X-Socorin-Client: socorin-desktop/<version> (<os>)`
//! and, once registered, `X-Socorin-Install: <installId>`. Failures are an
//! HTTP 4xx / 5xx with `{error, message, …}`; a proxy in front of the server
//! may answer with something that is not JSON, so the status code alone has
//! to be enough to say what went wrong (`describe_failure`).
