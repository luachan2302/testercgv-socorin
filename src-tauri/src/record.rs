//! Screen / region video recording.
//!
//! macOS uses the system `screencapture -v` (H.264 .mov, cursor included,
//! no extra dependency; it inherits the app's Screen Recording permission).
//! Windows records in-process with Windows.Graphics.Capture and Media
//! Foundation (`wgc`), with `ffmpeg` as the fallback (and as the recorder
//! when Settings → Recording names one). Linux (X11) uses `ffmpeg` (see
//! `ffmpeg_binary` for where it is looked for); on Wayland the ScreenCast
//! portal and GStreamer record a whole monitor (`screencast`). One recording at a time:
//! starting again stops the running one, stopping finalises the file,
//! reveals it in the file manager and reports `capture-done`.
//!
//! The microphone goes in too unless it is switched off (Settings →
//! Recording, or the bar's mic button): `audio::choose` picks the device,
//! macOS asks for the permission first (`macos::ensure_mic_permission`),
//! and the encoder gets it as `screencapture -g` / `-G<id>`, a WASAPI stream
//! into the Media Foundation encoder, or ffmpeg's `pulse` / `dshow` input.
//! When there is no sound after all (no microphone, no permission, a device
//! that could not be opened) the recording still runs, without it, and the
//! bar says why (`RecordingStatus::audio_issue`).
//!
//! The region is chosen on the capture overlay (`capture::Mode::Record`),
//! which is hidden before the encoder starts so it is never in the video.
//! While a region records, the Record / Cancel bar the overlay showed is
//! replaced, at the very same spot, by the `recorder` window (elapsed time,
//! Stop & copy, Stop & upload, Stop, Cancel); a full-screen recording shows
//! no bar at all and is driven from the (red) tray icon's menu. Stopping
//! finalises the file and reveals it, copies it to the clipboard, uploads
//! it to the share server (`share`), or discards it.
